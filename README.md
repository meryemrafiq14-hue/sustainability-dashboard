## Overview

The **Gies Impact Command Center** is an analytics dashboard that tracks sustainability research contributions from Gies College of Business faculty. It maps academic publications to the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and surfaces insights for academic leadership, faculty, and institutional reporting.

Under the hood, it runs a two-stage AI classification pipeline: LLMs handle relevance detection, and FAISS vector search handles SDG assignment. The frontend makes that output actually readable.

## Features

### Analytics & Visualization
- **SDG Distribution:** Research alignment across all 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals
- **Department Comparisons:** Sustainability contribution analysis broken down by academic department
- **Publication Trend Analysis:** Year-over-year research output and growth rate tracking
- **Impact KPI Cards:** Quick metrics for sustainability ratios and faculty engagement counts

### AI Classification Pipeline
- **Stage 1 (Relevance Detection):** LLM-based binary classification for whether a publication contributes to any sustainability goal
- **Stage 2 (SDG Identification):** FAISS vector similarity search that assigns the top 3 most relevant SDGs per publication with weighted relevance scores
- Accounts for both direct sustainability work and foundational research that supports SDG progress

### Collaboration Hub
A dedicated tab connecting Gies research gaps to external funding and partnership opportunities, embedded directly alongside the analytics.

- **Sustainability Case Competition portal** embedded via iframe with full interactivity
- **Quick-jump links** to Sponsor a Priority, SDG Gaps, Research Partnerships, and Case Competition tracks
- **Gap-to-sponsorship mapping:** Gies' most under-indexed SDGs (14, 15, 2) surface as open sponsorship tracks in the portal
- Context strip explains how the embedded portal connects to the dashboard's own gap analysis

### Search & Discovery
- **Advanced Filtering:** Filter by department, year, SDG goal, and journal tier
- **Journal Impact Tracking:** Publications cross-referenced against Financial Times and UT Dallas top-journal lists

### Data Sources
- **Illinois Experts API:** Pulls faculty profiles and publication metadata directly from the university's research database
- **Web Scraping:** Rate-limited scraping for supplemental research metadata
- **Journal Rankings Database:** Classifies publications by academic impact and business domain

## Navigation

The dashboard has five tabs:

| Tab | What it does |
|---|---|
| Overview | SDG wheel, gap index, department breakdown, AI snapshot |
| Network | Collaboration pairings and researcher profiles |
| Global Impact | World map, geospatial research reach, full SDG coverage |
| **Collaboration Hub** | **Embedded Case Competition portal, sponsorship tracks, partner links** |
| Who Uses This | Donor and student persona journeys |

---

## Technical Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React (single-file, GitHub Pages hosted) |
| AI Classification | OpenAI GPT models |
| Vector Search | FAISS + Pinecone |
| Data Pipeline | Python |
| Deployment | GitHub Pages |

---

## Data Architecture

The backend pipeline structures data across three layers:

**Faculty Records:** identifiers, department affiliations, active status, research keyword profiles

**Publication Database:** article metadata, DOIs, journal classifications, sustainability scores, SDG mappings

**Sustainability Analytics:** binary sustainability flags, ranked SDG assignments (top 3 per publication), temporal trends, department-level aggregations
