# CCS Demo Data Explanation
## What Data Was Used from Your Original CSV File

---

## 📊 **OVERVIEW**

The `CCS_Demo_Data.csv` file contains **simulated collaboration matches**
for demonstration purposes in your Power BI presentation. It shows how the
Collaboration Compatibility Score (CCS) algorithm would work when researchers
search for potential collaborators. The demo file was generated using the
scripted logic described below; the scripts are not included in this public
repository.

## 📁 **WHAT'S IN CCS_DEMO_DATA.CSV**

### **Structure:** 46 rows of collaboration matches

Each row represents:
- **A user** (researcher searching for collaborators)
- **A potential match** (another researcher)
- **Compatibility scores** (calculated)
- **Explanation** (generated text)

---

## ✅ **DATA FROM YOUR ORIGINAL CSV (USED DIRECTLY)**

### **1. Researcher Names**
**Source:** `name` column from original CSV  
**Used in CCS Demo:**
- `User_Name` - Name of researcher searching
- `Match_Name` - Name of matched researcher

**Example:**
- Original CSV: `"Ahsen, Mehmet"` appears in multiple publication rows
- Researcher_Profiles: Aggregated to one row per researcher
- CCS Demo: Used as `User_Name` or `Match_Name`

---

### **2. Department**
**Source:** `department` column from original CSV  
**Used in CCS Demo:**
- `User_Dept` - Department of searching researcher
- `Match_Dept` - Department of matched researcher

**Example:**
- Original CSV: `"Business Administration"` (repeated for each publication)
- Researcher_Profiles: `"Business Administration"` (one per researcher)
- CCS Demo: `"Business Administration"` in `User_Dept` or `Match_Dept`

---

### **3. Primary SDG (Sustainable Development Goal)**
**Source:** `top 1`, `top 2`, `top 3` columns from original CSV  
**How it was aggregated:**
- Collected all SDG values (top 1, top 2, top 3) across all publications per researcher
- Most frequent SDG = `primary_sdg`

**Used in CCS Demo:**
- `User_SDG` - SDG of searching researcher (70% uses actual `primary_sdg`, 30% varied for demo)
- `Match_SDG` - SDG of matched researcher (always uses actual `primary_sdg`)

**Example:**
- Original CSV: Multiple rows with `top 1 = 3.0`, `top 2 = 9.0`, `top 3 = 17.0`
- Researcher_Profiles: `primary_sdg = 3.0` (most common)
- CCS Demo: `User_SDG = 3` or `Match_SDG = 3`

---

### **4. Research Method**
**Source:** `keywords` and `abstract` columns from original CSV  
**How it was inferred:**
- Combined all keywords and abstracts for each researcher
- Scanned for method-related keywords (e.g., "machine learning", "statistical", "case study")
- Assigned method with highest keyword match count

**Used in CCS Demo:**
- `User_Method` - Method of searching researcher (60% uses actual `primary_method`, 40% varied for demo)
- `Match_Method` - Method of matched researcher (always uses actual `primary_method`)

**Example:**
- Original CSV: Keywords include "Machine Learning", "AI", "Deep Learning"
- Researcher_Profiles: `primary_method = "Computational"` (inferred)
- CCS Demo: `User_Method = "Computational"` or `Match_Method = "Computational"`

---

### **5. Career Stage**
**Source:** `publication_year` column from original CSV  
**How it was calculated:**
- Found `first_publication_year` (MIN of all publication years)
- Calculated `years_since_first = 2025 - first_publication_year`
- Assigned stage:
  - <7 years = "Pre-Tenure"
  - 7-15 years = "Post-Tenure"
  - >15 years = "Senior"

**Used in CCS Demo:**
- `User_Stage` - Always uses actual `career_stage` from Researcher_Profiles
- `Match_Stage` - Always uses actual `career_stage` from Researcher_Profiles

**Example:**
- Original CSV: Publication years: 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020
- Researcher_Profiles: `first_publication_year = 2012`, `years_since_first = 13`, `career_stage = "Post-Tenure"`
- CCS Demo: `User_Stage = "Post-Tenure"` or `Match_Stage = "Post-Tenure"`

---

### **6. Top Keywords**
**Source:** `keywords` column from original CSV  
**How it was aggregated:**
- Collected all keywords from all publications per researcher
- Counted frequency of each keyword
- Selected top 10 most frequent keywords

**Used in CCS Demo:**
- `Explanation` field - Uses first 2 keywords from matched researcher's `top_keywords`

**Example:**
- Original CSV: Keywords like "Cash Flow;Large Banks;Volatility;Hedging;..." (repeated across publications)
- Researcher_Profiles: `top_keywords = "Cash Flow;Large Banks;Volatility;Hedging;Industry;..."`
- CCS Demo: `Explanation = "Expertise in Cash Flow and Large Banks. ..."`

---

## 🧮 **CALCULATED FIELDS (NOT FROM ORIGINAL CSV)**

### **1. Topic_Match (70-95)**
**Calculation:** Based on SDG alignment
- **90-95:** Exact SDG match (`User_SDG == Match_SDG`)
- **85-90:** Related SDGs (same cluster: 1-6 Social, 7-12 Economic, 13-17 Environmental)
- **70-80:** Different SDG clusters

**Example:**
- User_SDG = 9, Match_SDG = 9 → Topic_Match = 92-95
- User_SDG = 9, Match_SDG = 8 (same cluster) → Topic_Match = 85-90
- User_SDG = 9, Match_SDG = 3 (different cluster) → Topic_Match = 70-80

---

### **2. Method_Match (70-95)**
**Calculation:** Based on method complementarity
- **85-95:** Complementary methods (Quantitative + Qualitative, e.g., Theoretical + Empirical)
- **70-80:** Same method or similar types

**Example:**
- User_Method = "Theoretical", Match_Method = "Empirical" → Method_Match = 85-95
- User_Method = "Theoretical", Match_Method = "Theoretical" → Method_Match = 70-80

---

### **3. Career_Fit (70-92)**
**Calculation:** Based on career stage pairing
- **85-92:** Mentorship opportunities (Pre-Tenure + Post-Tenure, Pre-Tenure + Senior)
- **75-82:** Peer collaboration (same stage, especially Post-Tenure)
- **70-80:** Other combinations

**Example:**
- User_Stage = "Pre-Tenure", Match_Stage = "Post-Tenure" → Career_Fit = 85-92
- User_Stage = "Post-Tenure", Match_Stage = "Post-Tenure" → Career_Fit = 75-82

---

### **4. CCS_Total (73-93)**
**Calculation:** Weighted sum
```
CCS_Total = ROUND((Topic_Match × 0.45) + (Method_Match × 0.40) + (Career_Fit × 0.15))
```

**Example:**
- Topic_Match = 95, Method_Match = 93, Career_Fit = 85
- CCS_Total = ROUND((95 × 0.45) + (93 × 0.40) + (85 × 0.15))
- CCS_Total = ROUND(42.75 + 37.2 + 12.75) = ROUND(92.7) = 93

---

### **5. Explanation (Text)**
**Generation:** Combines:
- First 2 keywords from matched researcher's `top_keywords`
- Method complementarity description
- Career pairing description

**Example:**
```
"Expertise in Gene Regulatory Network and Mixing Coefficient. 
Highly complementary methods (Empirical + Theoretical) create exceptional research synergy. 
Strong mentorship pairing: Post-Tenure and Post-Tenure researchers."
```
