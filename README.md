## 🎯 The Challenge

Universities generate extensive sustainability-related research, but this work is often **fragmented across departments, disciplines, and individuals**, creating critical barriers:

| **Problem** | **Impact** |
|----------------|---------------|
| Limited visibility into existing sustainability expertise | Missed collaboration opportunities across departments |
| Difficulty identifying collaborators with complementary skills | Reduced innovation potential and slower research formation |
| Lack of structured insights into SDG coverage and gaps | Inefficient resource allocation and strategic planning |
| Manual, time-intensive processes for finding partners | Slowed interdisciplinary team formation |

**Result**: Opportunities for impactful sustainability research and strategic initiatives are frequently missed.

---

## Our Solution

The **Illinois Sustainability Impact Engine** is a **5-component integrated platform** that transforms how universities discover, connect, and leverage sustainability research expertise.

### Platform Architecture

The Illinois Sustainability Impact Engine integrates **5 components** that work together to transform sustainability research discovery and collaboration:

- Calculates impact scores (journal tier, SDG alignment, recency)
- Enables researcher and department impact comparisons
- Visualizes sustainability outcomes and contributions
- Interactive web dashboard for exploring sustainability research

**Status**: Live web application

---

### 5. Collaboration Hub
**Smart Compatibility Matching**

**Addresses**: Difficulty identifying collaborators with complementary skills

**What it does**:

- **Rewards complementary methods** (e.g., Theoretical + Empirical) rather than just similarity
- **Three stakeholder paths**: Faculty (collaborator matching), Students (opportunities), Donors (funding priorities)
- **Transparent scoring**: Every recommendation is explainable

**Key Innovation**: The system actively rewards **methodological complementarity**, driving innovation by bringing together different research perspectives.

**Scoring Formula**:
```
CCS = (Topic × 45%) + (Method × 40%) + (Career × 15%)
```

**Status**: Live Streamlit web application
