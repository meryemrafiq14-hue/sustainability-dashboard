# Under the Hood: How the Streamlit App Works

> **Complete technical documentation of the Collaboration Hub Streamlit application, including NLP methodology, CCS scoring formula, and data processing**

---

## 🎯 Overview

The Collaboration Hub Streamlit app (`app.py`) is a real-time compatibility scoring system that analyzes original publication data to recommend research collaborators. This document explains exactly how it works under the hood.

**Key Principle**: This is **not predictive AI**. It's a transparent, rule-based system with NLP semantic analysis that decision-makers can understand and validate.

---

## 📊 Collaboration Compatibility Score (CCS) Formula

### Faculty Path - CCS Calculation

The CCS uses a **weighted formula** to calculate compatibility:

```
CCS = (Topic × 45%) + (Method × 40%) + (Career × 15%)
```

**Score Range**: 0-100

**Why these weights?**
- **Topic (45%)**: Research alignment is the foundation of successful collaboration
- **Method (40%)**: Complementary methods drive innovation (key innovation of the system)
- **Career (15%)**: Mentorship opportunities enhance but don't dominate collaboration quality

---

## 🔍 Topic Score (45%) - NLP Semantic Analysis

### How It Works

1. **User Input**: User selects SDG and research method, creating a research context string:
   ```
   "Research in SDG {target_sdg} using {user_method} methodology"
   ```

2. **Candidate Profile**: For each researcher in the dataset, the app combines:
   - **Keywords**: All keywords from their publications (from `keywords` column in original CSV)
   - **Abstracts**: First 2000 characters of abstracts (from `abstract` or `abstract_text` column)

3. **NLP Model**: Uses `sentence-transformers` library with the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model:
   - Generates **embeddings** (vector representations) of both user context and candidate research content
   - Calculates **cosine similarity** between the two embeddings
   - Scales similarity to 0-100 range

4. **Score Calculation**:
   ```python
   user_embedding = model.encode([user_context])
   candidate_embedding = model.encode([candidate_text])
   similarity = cosine_similarity(user_embedding, candidate_embedding)[0][0]
   topic_score = max(0, min(100, similarity * 100))
   ```

### Why NLP?

- **Semantic Understanding**: Captures meaning beyond exact keyword matches
- **Example**: "machine learning" and "artificial intelligence" are recognized as related even without exact keyword overlap
- **Real Data**: All analysis performed on actual keywords and abstracts from `publications.csv`

### Data Source

- **Keywords**: Extracted directly from `keywords` column in original CSV (semicolon-separated)
- **Abstracts**: Used from `abstract` or `abstract_text` column in original CSV
- **No Pre-processing**: All NLP analysis uses original publication data directly

## 🔬 Method Score (40%) - Complementarity Rules

### Key Innovation

The algorithm **rewards complementary methods** rather than similarity. This drives innovation by bringing together different methodological perspectives.

### Complementarity Matrix

The method score is calculated using a rule-based complementarity matrix:

| User Method | Candidate Method | Score | Rationale |
|------------|------------------|-------|-----------|
| Theoretical | Empirical | 100 | Strong complementarity - theory + data |
| Theoretical | Computational | 100 | Strong complementarity - theory + simulation |
| Theoretical | Experimental | 90 | Good complementarity |
| Theoretical | Fieldwork | 100 | Strong complementarity |
| Empirical | Theoretical | 100 | Strong complementarity |
| Empirical | Qualitative | 85 | Good complementarity |
| Empirical | Fieldwork | 90 | Good complementarity |
| Empirical | Computational | 80 | Moderate complementarity |
| Computational | Theoretical | 100 | Strong complementarity |
| Computational | Fieldwork | 85 | Good complementarity |
| Experimental | Theoretical | 90 | Good complementarity |
| Same Method | Same Method | 50 | Moderate - enables collaboration but less innovation |

### Method Inference

Research methods are inferred from keywords and abstracts in the original CSV:

- **Theoretical**: Keywords like "theory", "framework", "model", "conceptual"
- **Empirical**: Keywords like "data", "analysis", "survey", "statistical"
- **Computational**: Keywords like "simulation", "machine learning", "AI", "algorithm"
- **Experimental**: Keywords like "experiment", "trial", "laboratory", "RCT"
- **Qualitative**: Keywords like "interview", "case study", "ethnography"
- **Fieldwork**: Keywords like "field", "observation", "fieldwork"

The method with the highest keyword match count becomes the researcher's `primary_method`.

## 👥 Career Score (15%) - Mentorship & Collaboration Fit

### Why 15%?

We prioritize semantic research alignment and methodological fit first (85%), but apply a 15% weighting to career stages to actively foster junior-faculty mentorship and cross-seniority knowledge transfer.

### Career Stage Calculation

Career stages are inferred from publication years in the original CSV:

```python
years_since_first = current_year - first_publication_year

if years_since_first > 15:
    career_stage = "Senior"
elif years_since_first > 7:
    career_stage = "Post-Tenure"
else:
    career_stage = "Pre-Tenure"
```

### Career Score Matrix

| User Stage | Candidate Stage | Score | Rationale |
|------------|-----------------|-------|-----------|
| Pre-Tenure | Post-Tenure | 100 | Excellent mentorship opportunity |
| Pre-Tenure | Senior | 100 | Excellent mentorship opportunity |
| Post-Tenure | Senior | 100 | Cross-stage knowledge transfer |
| Post-Tenure | Post-Tenure | 75 | Good peer collaboration |
| Pre-Tenure | Pre-Tenure | 60 | Moderate peer collaboration |
| Other combinations | | 50 | Limited alignment |

### Benefits

- **Mentorship**: Pre-Tenure researchers connecting with Post-Tenure or Senior faculty
- **Peer Collaboration**: Researchers at similar stages working together
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Cross-generational research partnerships

## 🎓 Student Path - Opportunity Match Score

### Formula

```
Opportunity Match Score = (SDG Match × 50%) + (Method Match × 30%) + (Career Fit × 20%)
```

### Components

- **SDG Match (50%)**: Alignment with student's SDG interest
- **Method Match (30%)**: Overlap with student's skills
- **Career Fit (20%)**: Mentorship opportunities (students with senior faculty)

---

## 💰 Donor Path - Funding Gap Analysis

### How It Works

1. **SDG Coverage Calculation**:
   - Counts number of researchers per SDG (based on `primary_sdg` from original CSV)
   - Calculates average coverage across all 17 SDGs

2. **Gap Identification**:
   - Identifies SDGs with coverage **30% below average**
   - These are flagged as priority funding areas

3. **Visualization**:
   - Interactive bar chart showing coverage for all 17 SDGs
   - Color-coded: Orange (`#E84A27`) for gaps, Navy (`#13294B`) for well-covered SDGs

## 📁 Data Sources & Processing

### Original Data

- **File**: `publications.csv` (in repository root)
- **Format**: One row per publication
- **Fields Used**:
  - `person_uuid` - Unique researcher identifier
  - `name` - Researcher name
  - `department` - Department affiliation
  - `email` - Contact email
  - `publication_year` - Year of publication
  - `keywords` - Semicolon-separated keywords
  - `abstract` or `abstract_text` - Publication abstract
  - `top 1`, `top 2`, `top 3` - SDG labels (1-17)
  - `is_sustain` - Boolean flag for sustainability focus

### Profile Construction (On-the-Fly)

For each unique researcher (`person_uuid`), the app aggregates their publications:

1. **Basic Metrics**:
   - `total_publications` - Count of all publications
   - `sustainable_publications` - Count where `is_sustain = true`
   - `first_publication_year` - Earliest publication year
   - `last_publication_year` - Most recent publication year
   - `years_active` - `last_year - first_year`

2. **Career Stage**: Calculated from `years_since_first` (see Career Score section)

3. **Primary SDG**: Most frequent SDG across all publications (from `top 1`, `top 2`, `top 3` columns)

4. **Primary Method**: Inferred from keywords/abstracts (see Method Score section)

5. **Keywords & Abstracts**: Combined for NLP matching
   - All keywords aggregated and joined
   - First 2000 characters of abstracts combined

### No Pre-processing

- **All analysis performed in real-time** from original CSV
- **No intermediate files** or pre-processed data
- **No simulation** - all matching uses only real data from original publications CSV

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

### NLP Model

- **Library**: `sentence-transformers`
- **Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dimensional embeddings)
- **Caching**: Model loaded once and cached using `@st.cache_resource`
- **Batch Processing**: All candidate embeddings calculated in batch for performance

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Batch NLP Encoding**: All candidate texts encoded at once (much faster than one-by-one)
2. **Model Caching**: NLP model loaded once and reused across sessions
3. **Data Caching**: Researcher profiles cached using `@st.cache_data`
4. **Filtering**: SDG filtering allows related SDGs (same cluster) for broader matching

### File Loading

The app tries multiple paths to find `publications.csv`:
- Repository root: `../../publications.csv` (from `components/collab_hub/`)
- Streamlit Cloud: `/mount/src/sustainability_case_competition/publications.csv`
- Current directory fallbacks
