## ❌ Problem Statement

Universities generate extensive sustainability-related research, but this work is often fragmented across departments, disciplines, and individuals, leading to:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| ❌ Limited visibility into existing sustainability expertise | Missed collaboration opportunities |
| ❌ Difficulty identifying collaborators with complementary skills | Reduced innovation potential |
| ❌ Lack of structured insights into SDG coverage | Inefficient resource allocation |
| ❌ Manual, time-intensive processes for finding partners | Slowed research formation |

**Result**: Opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration and strategic sustainability initiatives are frequently missed.

---

## 🏗️ Solution Architecture

The platform consists of **5 integrated components** working together to address the fragmentation problem:

## 🧩 Platform Components

### 1. Sustainability Dashboard
**Purpose**: High-level visualization of research activity across all 17 UN SDGs

- Overview of sustainability research coverage and trends
- Quick identification of research strengths and gaps
- Strategic planning support for leadership

**Status**: Integrated in Power BI platform

---

### 2. Research Coverage Analysis
**Purpose**: Detailed analysis of research distribution, gaps, and trends

- Identifies areas of strength and opportunities for growth
- Department-level SDG coverage analysis
- Trend visualization over time

**Status**: Integrated in Power BI platform

---

### 3. Collaboration Hub ⭐ (Supplementary Component)

**Compatibility scoring tool** that recommends collaborators based on:
- **Topic alignment** (SDG + keyword overlap) - 50% weight
- **Method complementarity** (different methods score higher) - 35% weight
- **Career stage fit** (mentorship + peer collaboration) - 15% weight

#### Key Innovation
**Rewards complementary methods** (e.g., Theoretical + Empirical) rather than just similarity. This drives innovation by bringing together different perspectives.

#### Scoring Formula
```
CCS_Total = (Topic × 50%) + (Method × 35%) + (Career × 15%)
```

#### Features
- ✅ Transparent, rule-based scoring (not predictive AI)
- ✅ Explainable recommendations with natural language explanations
- ✅ Power BI dashboard with interactive filtering
- ✅ Complete methodology documentation

#### Positioning
**Supplementary tool**: The Collaboration Hub is a "nice-to-have" enhancement that adds compatibility scoring to help researchers find collaborators. The Sustainability Dashboard, Research Coverage Analysis, and Impact Engine work independently—the platform functions without the Hub, but it adds value when researchers want to find collaborators.

#### 📚 Complete Documentation
